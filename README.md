### What I learned

This project really thought me alot, especially in the aspect of using useEffect for data fetching and useState for re-rendering. I also learnt how to filter data based on users preference.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp]https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This freecodecamp fullstack curriculum is helping me understand Javascript.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

You should create a web page that includes the following elements:
Create a coffee listing page that matches the given design.

Create a Reusable Card component.
The card component should include a picture, name, pricing, rating, and number of votes if exists.
The card component should render popular tag, availability status and ratings conditionally.
Render Coffee list with given data. The data should come from a given API or downloaded JSON file.
